# Resume
A resume template in the LaTeX Markup Language.
Due to the customizability that the software LaTeX provides for documentation, I think it is better than alternatives like Microsoft Word or Google Docs.
This is for anyone to use as a template.
**NOTE** This is not my personal resume and is a sample template. Although my personal resume does use this template. Additionally, I personally use Overleaf to access LaTeX.
